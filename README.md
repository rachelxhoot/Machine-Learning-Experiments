# Machine Learning Experiment Repository

## About

Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence aimed at enhancing computer systems' performance through learning and experience. It encompasses various algorithms and technologies that enable computers to learn patterns, make intelligent decisions, and execute specific tasks without explicit programming.

This [page](https://rachelxhoot.com/Machine-Learning-Experiments-58192eff7d9e47c6a38fcab4e2a24521) provides a detailed introduction to the experimental content.
